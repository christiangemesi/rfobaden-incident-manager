# Introduction

This is the source code for the _RFO Baden IncidentManager_.
It is an incident management tool written for the specific use case of the RFO Baden.
It was originally developed by a group of students at the FHNW Brugg-Windisch in the context of a project spanning two semesters.

## Structure

The IncidentManager is split in two parts: a backend and a frontend.

- The backend consists of a REST-API, backed by an SQL database.
  It's source code can be found in the `backend/` directory.
  An introduction to the backend can be found [here](./backend/001-backend-introduction.md).
- The frontend consists of a JavaScript client, which makes use of the backend to load and modify data.
  It's source code can be found in the `frontend/` directory.
  An introduction to the backend can be found [here](./frontend/001-frontend-introduction.md).
