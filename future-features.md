# Future Features

This documents lists future features for the IncidentManager. These features are mostly ideas, and should give inspiration as to how the IncidentManager can be expanded in the future.

## 1. Bug Fixes

### 1.1. Footer Offset on Mobile

The footer is not nicely aligned with the bottom of the page on some mobile devices. May need further investigation.

## 2. Features

### 2.1. Incident Close History

Incidents track the reason as to why they were closed. Opening and closing an incident multiple times creates a chain of such close reasons. Currently, these close reasons are never displayed to the user.

### 2.2. Monitoring Page

Implement a page which shows the top reports of an incident in a clear and expansive way. This page is indented to be used for display of an incident on a big, central desktop screen allowing multiple people to quickly grasp what's going on.

### 2.3. Statistics

Track and display statistics.

### 2.4. Audit Trail

Track who changed what when.

### 2.5. Pinning

Allow the user to pin parts of the application, such as incidents, reports, etc. This would cause them to be more readily accessible to that user, e.g. by appearing on the start page.

### 2.6. Action Feedback

Give feedback to the user when executing certain actions, e.g. when deleting something. This could be done by using alerts.

## 3. Technical

### 3.1. Navigate with Arrows in Select

The select component does not allow selection of its options via arrow keys. Users always have to use a mouse.

## 4. Design

### 4.1 Logo

Design a unique logo for the IncidentManager.

### 4.2 Favicon

Add a favicon to the frontend using a unique IncidentManager logo.
